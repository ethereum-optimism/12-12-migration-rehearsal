# 12-12-migration-rehearsal

This repository contains a set of scripts to help you set up infrastructure for our public migration rehearsal on December 12th. It will be deleted once the rehearsal is over.

The configuration files in this repo is designed to be a template for your own infrastructure. They do not run out of the box. Some values will be provided on migration day; these can be found between angle brackets (`<>`) in the config files. Please refer to the migration Notion document for information on exactly which values will be provided on migration day, as well as a more in-depth overview of how the migration will work.

If you have feedback, please message us on Slack or Discord.
